# Color Challenge
## ACS-3330 Single Page Web Applications

### AI Reflection

#### Prompts Used:
1. "Is this the best way to reset the colors?" - Asked about optimizing my state management approach 
2. "Is this the best way I can set the answer?" - Asked for a review of my `answer` and `setAnswer` state implementation.

#### How AI Helped:
AI assisted with refactoring repetitive code and suggested alternatives for managing state. It also helped debug the onClick event handlers that weren't functioning correctly, leading to a more maintainable implementation.

#### What I Figured Out:
I independently implemented the checkGuess function logic and designed the game's core mechanics, including how to represent the relationship between the displayed target color and the colored squares that users need to match.
